        medicine to
        the most deprived group of individuals in Pune, India. Under their organization, Soham Trust, these doctors for
        beggars treat individuals that do not have financial means for medical treatments. “We provide all the basic
        health care and investigations on [the] road itself to the elder beggars, who are abandoned by their families
        and who are begging just to survive in this world,” says Dr. Abhijit.</p>
