      <p class="lead text-justify">In India, women have to suffer discrimination right from birth, including lack of
        access to proper
        diet, education, employment, right to inherit property, health care, when and whom to marry, basic minimum wages
        and social security. Social security benefits for widows are few and paltry, and non-existent for separated or
        abandoned women. The number of senior citizens in India is projected to reach 15.87 crores in 2025. A higher
        proportion of elderly are expected to be women (the sex ratio of the elderly is projected to increase to 1,060
        women to 1,000 men by 2026).</p>
